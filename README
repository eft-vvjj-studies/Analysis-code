#How To Run
- Make sure the appropriate Delphes files are referenced in the samples in the list with Touples called "samples". (Currently the Code is set up to use a file called Samples with Siddharth's shared files inside)
- You can then change the filters, histograms, and regions. By adjusting the python list with toupes with correpsonding names 
- The python code at the end of the file will then go through each sample listed returning a multiple histograms for each filter.
- Then Run the code, and all the outputs will be spit out in the outputs.root file.

#Extra Notes 
- Only the Z 4 vectors is returned in the WZMass function, for different W and Z having different flavor leptons. 
- Working on implimenting the W mass return for different lepton flavors.
- This is my first README so any comments are welcome.
